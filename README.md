The second method solves the problem of displaying the document number on the screen, but blocks of three letters are replaced with ***

The third method solves the problem of displaying only one letter from the document number in the format yyy/yyy/y/y in lowercase.

The fourth method solves the problem of displaying letters from the document number in the format "Letters:yyy/yyy/y/y" in upper case (implementation using the StringBuilder class)

The fifth method checks whether the document number contains the sequence "abc" and whether the message contains or not in any case

The sixth method checks whether the document number begins with the sequence 555.

The seventh method checks whether the document number ends with the sequence 1a2b.
